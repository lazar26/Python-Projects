**PARKING TICKET**
1) Create a New Parking Ticket 
The police officers use this feature to enter parking tickets they write every day into the system. For each ticket, system asks for the ticket number (a number between 1­20000), the dollar amount on the ticket (currency) and the plate number of the car (it is really a text with no spaces). Each ticket has a status flag associated with it ­­ either paid or unpaid. Upon entering a ticket into the system, the status of that ticket is automatically set to unpaid.
2) Pay a Parking Ticket 
Upon payment received, we would like to mark the tickets as paid. The officer enters the ticket number, the program should find the ticket and change its status to paid.
3) Report by Plate Number 
The officer enters a plate number and the program lists all tickets associated with that plate number and displays the total money owed ­­ sum the amounts on each ticket and display the result as total amount owed.
4) Grand Report 
Displays all the tickets in the program along with their paid/unpaid status. It also reports the number of paid tickets and the number of unpaid are in the system.
5) Exit 
Exits the program.
