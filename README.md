**PARKING TICKET** 1) Create a New Parking Ticket: The police officers use this feature to enter parking tickets they write every day into the system. For each ticket, system asks for the ticket number (a number between 1­20000), the dollar amount on the ticket (currency) and the plate number of the car (it is really a text with no spaces). Each ticket has a status flag associated with it ­­ either paid or unpaid. Upon entering a ticket into the system, the status of that ticket is automatically set to unpaid. 2) Pay a Parking Ticket: Upon payment received, we would like to mark the tickets as paid. The officer enters the ticket number, the program should find the ticket and change its status to paid. 3) Report by Plate Number: The officer enters a plate number and the program lists all tickets associated with that plate number and displays the total money owed ­­ sum the amounts on each ticket and display the result as total amount owed. 4) Grand Report: Displays all the tickets in the program along with their paid/unpaid status. It also reports the number of paid tickets and the number of unpaid are in the system. 5) Exit: Exits the program.

**Diagnostic Assist**
Your job is to write a program that would allow us to diagnose diseases based on a given symptom.
[60] Feature #1: Display # of Diseases
This will display the number of diseases in the system -- NOT the symptoms!
Notice that diseases are in order in the file -- you can take advantage of this. Go through each disease in the system and whenever you see that the current record’s disease name is different than the previous record’s disease name, then increment a counter. 
[60] Feature 2: # of Symptoms per Disease Report
This will display how many symptoms are in the system for ​each d​ isease.
[100] Feature 3: Diagnose
This will ask user for a symptom and display all diseases that have that symptom.

**Antique Car Search**
Your task is to write a python program that would read the provided file containing a list of Antique cars. For each car, the file provides the Model, MPG, Horsepower and Origin. Given the information in the file, implement the following features:
Feature #1: Search Car
This feature allows user to search the database based on the minimum mile per gallon (MPG) and Horsepower. Once user input the minimum required MPG and horsepower, the program should display the cars that match the criteria.
Feature #2: Best and Worst Green Cars
This feature would report the average MPG of all the cars in the system along with the car that has the best and the worst MPG.
Feature #3: Inventory By Origin
We time to time would like to see how many american, european, japanese, taiwanese etc. cars in the inventory. Ask user for the origin and display how many cars from that origin we have in the database.
Please refer to the screenshot on the left for more information on each feature.
These features should be presented in a menu. Using the menu, user can choose the feature to use.
